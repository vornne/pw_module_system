== INFO ==
The eval function is implemented using muParser (http://muparser.sourceforge.net)

== VARIABLES ==
Registers can be read by adding {regx} to the expression string. Registers cannot be written to. They are evaluated before the expression, and can be used to form variable names.
(feval, "@fp1={reg0}+{reg1}") => stores the sum of reg0 and reg1 into fp1
(feval, "@fp{reg0}=1") => stores 1 into floating point register x, where x is the value of reg0

Floating point registers can be read and written like normal variables (without using { and }).
(feval, "@fp1=fp2+fp3") => stores the sum of fp2 and fp3 into fp1

Position registers can be read and written like normal variables (without using { and })
To access the origin components of a position, append the component (x, y, z) to the register name
To access the transformation components of a position, append the vector abbreviation (side: s, front: f, up: u) and the component (x, y, z) to the register name
(feval, "@fp1=pos2x") => stores the x origin component of position register2 into floating point register 1
(feval, "@pos3fy=1") => sets the y component of front vector (y scale in a transformation matrix) of position register 3 to 1

Chaining expressions:
A single eval can have multiple expressions, separated by a comma.
(feval, "@fp1=1,fp2=3,fp3=3") => fp1, fp2 and fp3 will be set to 1, 2 and 3 respectively
(feval, "@pos0x=(pos1y*pos2z)-(pos1z*pos2y),pos0y=(pos1z*pos2x)-(pos1x*pos2z),pos0z=(pos1x*pos2y)-(pos1y*pos2x)") => Stores the cross product of the origins of pos1 and pos2 into the origin of pos0
